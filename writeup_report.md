**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Implement a neural network architecture based on the Nvidia model in Keras to predict steering angle from images.
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py - top level script containing the main method. Makes calls to methods declared in other files below.
* cloning_models.py - Implements a simple NN, Lenet, Nvidia and a ELU based model. The best model is the Nvidia model.
* augmentation.py - Code to augment the input training set. It primarily flips the left, center and right images.
* generator.py - Contains generator code used to generate batches of data. This enables the model to be run on very large datasets.
* sampler.py - Contains code to break up the training set into 25 buckets. Downsamples buckets which have a lot of examples to prevent model from overfitting to these classes.  
* drive.py - for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 - containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md - summarizing the results
* train_steering.png - Scatter plot of error vs expected training values. The network seems to under predict the values most of the time.
* sample_scatter_3_.png - Shows the distribution of number of training examples in the 25 buckets. Its clear that three of the buckets are heavily skewed

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. It is a top level script which does the following.
* Parse command line arguments.
* Based on the input arguments, chooses a model to train.
* Augments the training set by flipping the left, middle and right
  images horizontally and using the negative of the steering value.
* Splits the training set into 25 buckets. The distribution shows that
  three buckets dominate and others have much fewer examples. Down samples
  the three frequent ones so that model does not give undue importance
  to those.
* Creates a generator and uses it to load the training and validation set
  in batches.
* Trains the model and saves it.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model is based on the model proposed by Nvidia (cloning_models.py lines 57-72). The model is described in detail [here](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf). 

The model first normalizes the input (cloning_models.py line 10) using a Keras lambda layer. It also crops a part of the top of the image (cloning_models.py line 11). This is followed by five convolutional layers (cloning_models.py line 60-64) and a flatten layer. Lastly, there are four dense layers (cloning_models.py lines 67-70). All the convolutional layers include the RELU activation.
 

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

Data augmentation was used to reduce overfitting of the model. For each image in the training set (left, center or right), an augmented image was generated by flipping the image horizontally and negating the steering value. (augmentation.py lines 17-45). 

In addition to the data provided by the udacity team, I generated additional data on my own. In this data, I drove the car in the opposite
direction to the normal direction so that the model could generalize better.

One of the key changes I had to make to the training for the model to
perform well was down sampling. I split the training examples into 25
buckets based on the expected value of the steering in the training set.
It showed a clear skewed dataset where there were three modes. I hypothesized that the model was overfitting on these majority buckets. I thus downsampled some of these modal buckets and the model improved substantially (it drove the track without problems).

Another thing I did was to try to teach the model to recover when the car is about to veer off the road. I did this by driving towards the edge of the lane in both directions then correcting to the center.

All of the above techniques played a part in improving the model and reducing overfitting.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 25).

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road ... 

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to ...

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the ... I thought this model might be appropriate because ...

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that ...

Then I ... 

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I ....

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...

Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image2]

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to .... These images show what a recovery looks like starting from ... :

![alt text][image5]

Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image6]
![alt text][image7]

Etc ....

After the collection process, I had X number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by ...


I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put Y% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was Z as evidenced by ... I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
